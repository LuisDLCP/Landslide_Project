Pasos para obtener los mapas y grÃ¡ficos de deslizamientos

1) Open "Interferometry_main.py"
   This file has the following parts:
   a) Get SAR Images: get_images()
   b) Load Imaging SAR parameters: np.load()
   c) Get interferograms: make_interferometry()
   d) Get displacement vs time graphics: get_displacements() 

2) There are many ways to launch the program depending on the initial data you have
   a) If you have Phase History or Raw Data:
      -> Execute all the functions, since "get_images()" function.
      -> Phase History is saved on a diferent folder called "Data_Set", each file is a "*.hdf5" file.
	 You can change the file path in get_images() function.
          
   b) If you have Imaging Data(after SAR-Imaging proccessing)
      -> Ignore the first function: get_images(), and execute the rest of the functions, since np.load()
      -> Imaging data has to be saved in Output_Imaging folder

3) A special folder is created to show all the results, its called RawData_n, and it contains the following folders:
   a) Output_Imaging: Imaging data is saved here
   b) SAR_Images: SAR Images are saved here
   c) Interferograms: Interferograms are save here 
   d) Statistical_graphs: Displacement vs time graphics are saved here

INPUT DATA 
----------------
1) dir_input_files: It's Raw Data directory. Change it in the header of script "Interferometry_main.py"
