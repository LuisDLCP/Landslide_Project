Overview:
This is the first development of Landslide Monitoring using SAR files.
The FDBP Algorithm is used to form SAR images. 

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Main file: 
	"Interferometria_main.py"

Dependencies:
	"BP_real_main.py": The FDBP Algorithm is implemented here.
	"RMA_real_main.py" (optional): The RMA Algorithm is implemented here
	"sarPrm.py": All the parameters(electrical, mechanical, 		
	           geometrical) are defined here.
	"drawFigures.py": Useful drawing function are found here.
	"SARdata.py": Theoric Raw Data code is developed here.
